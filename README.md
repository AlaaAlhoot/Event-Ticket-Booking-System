# Event-Ticket-Booking-System
is a Django-based web application for managing and booking event tickets. It supports two roles: Attendees (who can book, cancel, and download tickets) and Organizers (who can create events and view stats). The system includes secure payments, role-based access, and a complaint feature for all users â€” including guests.
